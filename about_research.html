        <p>Achieving net-zero requires extensive economic changes in the world of work for many. Some sectors will pivot to new activities to meet the demands of the net zero transition. Others will decline entirely as technologies become redundant and others emerge. An estimated 7% of the UK workforce will witness these changes (approximately 2.2 million people): for many, net zero will have important personal and community-level impacts. These experiences will represent an economic shock which, if not mitigated, could be as significant as previous deindustrialisation and coal mine closure.</p>

        <p>We have developed a net-zero vulnerability index (NZVI) to reveal the people and places where these impacts might be clustered. This research plugs a gap in current understandings of this vulnerability by tracing and mapping which communities in the UK are both vulnerable to economic change.</p>

        <p>This work has been funded by the <a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/poverty-institute/" target="_blank">Bristol Poverty Institute</a> via its 2024 Seedcorn Fund, as well as ESRC Impact Acceleration funding (2024).</p>
