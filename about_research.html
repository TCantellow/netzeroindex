        <p><strong>Achieving net-zero</strong> requires extensive economic changes in the world of work for many. Some sectors will pivot to new activities to meet the demands of the net zero transition. New jobs will emerge. <strong> Others will decline entirely </strong> as technologies become redundant. An estimated 7% of the UK workforce will experience these changes (approximately <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CCC-A-Net-Zero-Workforce-Web.pdf" target="_blank">2.2 million people</a>). <strong>This process is already active.</strong>

        <p>Impacts will not be distributed evenly. Understanding the geography of economic vulnerability and resilience - <strong>where the winners and losers are likely to be</strong> - is essential to develop place-based policies to mitigate the unintended negative consequences of the UK's net zero transition. We have developed a <strong>Net Zero Vulnerability Index (NZVI)</strong> to reveal the people and places where these impacts might be clustered. This research plugs a gap in current understandings of this vulnerability by tracing and mapping which communities in the UK are vulnerable to economic change.</p>
