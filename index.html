        <h1>Net Zero Vulnerability Index (NZVI)</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            The Net Zero Vulnerability Index (NZVI) offers a comprehensive framework to assess the vulnerability of regions within the UK to socio-economic disruptions arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy. This model addresses the risk of economic restructuring by examining factors such as industry complexity, inter-industry relationships, employment reliance on at-risk sectors, and population size. These components together form a resilience and vulnerability profile that highlights areas most likely to face significant socio-economic impacts as a result of net-zero transitions. In doing so, the NZVI goes beyond simple employment loss metrics, integrating socio-technical elements to reflect both economic and community adaptability to changes in traditional industries.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
            By assessing employment landscape characteristics (complexity), economic interdependencies (relatedness), dependency on key sectors (reliance), and the proportion of the local population affected, the NZVI provides a multidimensional view of regional vulnerabilities. As sectors vital to the carbon economy transition, some regions are anticipated to experience significant upheavals, such as those heavily reliant on fossil-fuel-based employment. This index sheds light on the broader socio-economic challenges that accompany decarbonization, helping policymakers, local authorities, and researchers identify regions most in need of support in their journey toward a more sustainable economy.
